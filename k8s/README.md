# what is this

I'm deploying this to my sandbox cluster.

`k apply -f k8s.yaml`

see jessitron/infra/otel-demo-help/o11yday-ingress.yaml for the ingress.

this is not a rigorous deployment but I just wanted it to be out there so I can show people.

This one depends on a secret that I threw into my cluster, and it reports to o11y-xp-workshop team, prod env.
